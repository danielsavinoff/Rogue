# Rogue
### Idea
In this project I wanted to demonstrate that I am capable of writing clean high-quality code and have deep knowledge of vanila Javascript. 
I strived to make it as much as possible compliant to the current industry standards such as:
- **SOLID**
- **DRY**
- **KISS**
Worth to note, that I have used prototypes instead of syntax-sugar classes because it provides clearer understanding how inheritance in Javascript & prototype chaining works and to ensure the maximum compatibility.
